When checked out from SVN:

to build current m4 directory: 
	gettextize -f
to build aclocal.m4: 
	aclocal -I m4
to build standard config.h.in: 
	autoheader
to generate configure file: 
	autoconf
to generate Makefile.in from Makefile.am:
	automake

After that (or for distributed source package):
	./configure
	make
	make install
